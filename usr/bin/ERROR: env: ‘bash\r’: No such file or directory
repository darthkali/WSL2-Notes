Check your path, echo $PATH. WSL2 normally imports Windows path there. To fix this create file /etc/wsl.conf in WSL2:

[interop]
appendWindowsPath = false
Then restart WSL2 with wsl --shutdown
Then check your path is shorter now and doesn't include any Windows dependencies:
echo $PATH

Worked for me.
